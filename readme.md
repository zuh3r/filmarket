This project allows users to buy and sell digital art and photography online to be stored in their virtual gallery.

## My plan/approach

I had hand drawn the basic wireframe of my app and listed the features I had wanted to implement.
Features inlude:
- Ability to buy art piece which transfers it from marketplace to gallery as well as selling art piece which did the opposite
- A live dollar value as to the amount of money in the users account.
