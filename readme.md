# FILMARKET

link: https://filmarket-project.herokuapp.com
This project allows users to buy and sell digital art and photography online to be stored in their virtual gallery.

## My plan/approach

I had hand drawn the basic wireframe of my app and listed the features I had wanted to implement.

Features inlude:
- Ability to buy art piece which transfers it from marketplace to gallery as well as selling art piece which did the opposite
- A live dollar value as to the amount of money in the users account.
- Ability to upload your own art piece which can then be sold in the marketplace.
- Ability to sign up/login to your account with a BCrypt encrypted password.
- Able to view art in the marketplace without logging in.

## Cool tech that I used

- BCrypt to encrypt password.
- Linking web application to local database.
- Using Heroku to deploy site.

## Lessons I learnt

- I learnt how effective 'pry' can be for debugging purposes.
- I learnt how important using the correct SQL function is for an app to be functional.

## Features to add in the future

- The ability to upload an image to the server rather than an image URL.
- Add a page that allows users to share their galleries so that other users can see them for inspiration.
- Instead of automatically being paid for selling a piece, I would like to add a feature that requires an art piece to be purchased before the seller is credited their funds
